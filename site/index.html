  <h2>What is the Life Cycle Of The Sun?</h2>
  <section id="section1">
    <h3>Section1</h3>
    <p>The Sun has always been the center of our cosmological systems.
    But with the advent of modern astronomy, humans have become aware
    of the fact that the Sun is merely one of countless stars in our
    Universe. In essence, it is a perfectly normal example of a
    G-type main-sequence star (G2V, aka. “yellow dwarf”). And
    like all stars, it has a lifespan, characterized
    The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect ball of hot
    plasma,[18][19] heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating
    the energy mainly as visible light, ultraviolet light, and infrared radiation. It is by far the most
    important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers (864,000 miles),
    or 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, and it accounts for about 99.86% of
    the total mass of the Solar System.[20] Roughly three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the
    rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon,
    neon and iron.[21]</p>

    <h3>Section2</h3>
    <p>This lifespan began roughly 4.6 billion years ago, and will continue for about another 4.5
      – 5.5 billion years, when it will deplete its supply of hydrogen, helium, and collapse into a white dwarf.
    But this is just the abridged version of the Sun’s lifespan. As always, God (or the Devil, depending on who you ask)
    is in the details!The enormous effect of the Sun on Earth has been recognized since prehistoric times. The Sun was
    thought of by some cultures as a deity. The synodic rotation of Earth and its orbit around the Sun are the basis of
    some solar calendars. The predominant calendar in use today is the Gregorian calendar which is based upon the standard
    16th Century interpretation that the Sun's observed movement is primarily due to it actually moving.[23]</p>

    <h3>Section3</h3>
    <p>To break it down, the Sun is about half way through the most stable part of its life. Over the course of the past four
    billion years, during which time planet Earth and the entire Solar System was born, it has remained relatively unchanged.
    This will stay the case for another four billion years, at which point, it will have exhausted its supply of hydrogen fuel.
    When that happens, some pretty drastic things will take place!According to its spectral class, the Sun is a G-type main-sequence
    star (G2V). As such, it is informally, and not completely accurately, referred to as a yellow dwarf (its light is closer
    to white than yellow). It formed approximately 4.6 billion[a][14][22] years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter
    within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into
    an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear
    fusion in its core. It is thought that almost all stars form by this process.</p>

    <h3>Section4</h3>
    <h4>The Birth of the Sun:</h4>
    According to Nebular Theory, the Sun and all the planets of our Solar System began as a giant cloud of molecular
    gas and dust. Then, about 4.57 billion years ago, something happened that caused the cloud to collapse. This could have been
    the result of a passing star, or shock waves from a supernova, but the end result was a gravitational collapse at the center of the cloud.
    The Sun does not have a definite boundary, but its density decreases exponentially with increasing height above the photosphere.[39] For
    the purpose of measurement, the Sun's radius is considered to be the distance from its center to the edge of the photosphere, the apparent
    visible surface of the Sun.[40] By this measure, the Sun is a near-perfect sphere with an oblateness estimated at 9 millionths,[41] which
    means that its polar diameter differs from its equatorial diameter by only 10 kilometres (6.2 mi).[42] The tidal effect of the planets is weak
    and does not significantly affect the shape of the Sun.[43] The Sun rotates faster at its equator than at its poles. This differential rotation
    is caused by convective motion due to heat transport and the Coriolis force due to the Sun's rotation. In a frame of reference defined by the stars,
    the rotational period is approximately 25.6 days at the equator and 33.5 days at the poles. Viewed from Earth as it orbits the Sun, the
    apparent rotational period of the Sun at its equator is about 28 days.[44] Viewed from a vantage point above its north pole, the Sun
    rotates counterclockwise around its axis of spin.[d][45]

    <h3>Section5</h3>
    From this collapse, pockets of dust and gas began to collect into denser regions. As the denser regions
    pulled in more and more matter, conservation of momentum caused it to begin rotating, while increasing pressure caused it
    to heat up. Most of the material ended up in a ball at the center while the rest of the matter flattened out into disk that circled around it.
    The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star that constitutes about 99.86% of the mass of the Solar System. The Sun has an absolute magnitude of +4.83,
    estimated to be brighter than about 85% of the stars in the Milky Way, most of which are red dwarfs.[30][31] The Sun is a Population I, or
    heavy-element-rich,[b] star.[32] The formation of the Sun may have been triggered by shockwaves from one or more nearby supernovae.[33]
    This is suggested by a high abundance of heavy elements in the Solar System, such as gold and uranium, relative to the abundances of these
    elements in so-called Population II, heavy-element-poor, stars. The heavy elements could most plausibly have been produced by endothermic
    nuclear reactions during a supernova, or by transmutation through neutron absorption within a massive second-generation star.[32]
